This code isn't intended to be efficient or reasonable.  Instead, it was created for educational purposes.

Another user created a file, https://gist.github.com/CodingAnarchy/e7b53c30c5755b3485b6 , 
intended as a Monty Hall simulation. However, it doesn't stick to the rules laid out in 
the original problem. I made a version in the same style, but which does stick to those rules, 
in order to demonstrate the issues present.
